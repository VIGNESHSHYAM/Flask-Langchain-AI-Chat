# Flask-Langchain-AI-Chat
 This Flask project integrates Google's Generative AI (Gemini Pro) into a chatbot named AI, leveraging Cassandra for conversation history. An API endpoint ("/ask") allows users to query the chatbot, receiving context-aware responses based on historical interactions.

In this Flask-based project, the seamless integration of Google's powerful Generative AI, Gemini Pro, empowers AI, an intelligent chatbot. Cassandra is employed as the database backend to store and manage comprehensive conversation history. The API endpoint ("/ask") facilitates user interaction, allowing dynamic queries to AI and receiving responses that reflect contextual understanding based on historical engagements.

The project's architecture includes a well-defined conversation template, guiding AI behavior and ensuring coherent and informative replies. An innovative large language model (LLM) chain enhances the chatbot's contextual awareness.
